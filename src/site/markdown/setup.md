Generating the Cipher Text
==========================

You can use any KMS methods (API, CLI, etc) to generate the cipher text.

Once you have generated a customer master key and add your IAM user as a user of that key, you can generate the cipher text.  Using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is the simplist method.  The output from the following command is the ENCRYPTEDPASSPHRASE which can be read from a file (via scheme awskms:file:) or used directly (via scheme awskms:literal:):

    aws kms encrypt --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:XXXXXXXXXXXX:key/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX  --plaintext "PASSPHRASE" --output text --query CiphertextBlob

In the command above, replace PASSPHRASE with the passphrase for your key and make sure to replace the key-id arn (starts with arn:aws:kms.....) with your key-id (available via the AWS console or CLI 'aws kms list-keys').

**NOTE: Do not use the cipher text generated by the [AWS Encryption SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-java).  The cipher text generated is not directly compatible with the KMS service.**

AWS Credentials
===============

Currently, the plugin uses the default credential handler from the aws-java-sdk.  Configuration and initialization priorities are described [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html).  The ability to supply credentials via the PASSPHRASE_SPECIFIER is coming in a future release.
